1. $A[i] = -A[i]$ mod M so we can abuse this property which such problems related  to (a[i] + b[i]) \mod M
2. Wilson theorem : $n$ is a prime number iff $(n-1)! = n-1$ mod n. 
3. $x = a$ mod n and $x = a$ mod m means $x = a$ mod lcm(m,n)
4. Find $a^x = b$ mod m with baby step - giant step algo (discrete log)
5. A[x \mod a] = B[x \mod b] => pattern of size gcd(a,b).  
6. Consider primitive root with problems with product modulo
