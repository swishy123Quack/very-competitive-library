A permutation is called heaplike if value of parent nodes is smaller/larger than its children.

If there are no constraints, probability of a node $u$ to belongs to a heaplike tree is independent with all other nodes. $P(u) = 1/(size of subtree u)$.

The number of heaplike permuation is $N! / P(u)$
