1. And, or, gcd as f : F(i) = j that f[j..i] <= X, F(i) <= F(i+1) so we can do some magical things like binary search on this function.
2. Mex : In a permutation, mex(l,r) = min(mex(1,r), mex(l,n))
3. X = $\sum_{D} \phi(D)$ for all Divisor D of X. In some cases we can use this property to calculate gcd(a,b).
